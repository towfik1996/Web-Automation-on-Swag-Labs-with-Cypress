# Web-Automation-on-Swag-Labs-with-Cypress
We use Cypress for web automation because it is a powerful and modern JavaScript-based testing framework that allows for fast and reliable testing of web applications. Cypress provides a simple and intuitive API for writing tests and comes with built-in tools for debugging and writing assertions. It also has features such as time-traveling debugger, automatic retries, and real-time reloads that make the process of writing and debugging tests easier and more efficient. Additionally, Cypress provides excellent documentation and a supportive community, making it easier to get started and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
